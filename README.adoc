This the Spring Boot Student app.
Note: A Jenkins build is triggered from a commit using serveo exposed webhook.

== Running the Application

To run the application, run the following command in a terminal window (in the `complete`)
directory:

====

Ensure Maven is installed and run the following command in a terminal window (in the `complete`)
directory:

====
[source,text]
----
mvn spring-boot:run
----
====

You should see output similar to the following:

====
[source,text]
----
Loading students:
loading: Student [id=1, firstName=Sam, lastName=Smith, email=sammysmith@live.com, birthDate=2012-03-12]
loading: Student [id=2, firstName=Ralph, lastName=Thomas, email=RalphThomas@gmail.com, birthDate=2010-11-01]
----

====
[source,text]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/students
[
{
"id": 1,
"firstName": "Sam",
"lastName": "Smith",
"email": "sammysmith@live.com",
"birthDate": "2012-03-12"
},
{
"id": 2,
"firstName": "Ralph",
"lastName": "Thomas",
"email": "RalphThomas@gmail.com",
"birthDate": "2010-11-01"
}
]

The actuator exposes the following:

* http://localhost:8080/actuator/health[actuator/health]
* http://localhost:8080/actuator[actuator]

NOTE: There is also an `/actuator/shutdown` endpoint, but, by default, it is visible only
through JMX. To http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/{spring_boot_version}/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-endpoints-enabling-endpoints[enable it as an HTTP endpoint], add
`management.endpoint.shutdown.enabled=true` to your `application.properties` file
and expose it with `management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info,shutdown`.
However, you probably should not enable the shutdown endpoint for a publicly available
application.

You can check the health of the application by running the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
{"status":"UP"}
